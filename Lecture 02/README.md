## 🧠 Prompt Engineering
Prompt Engineering involves creating effective inputs for AI models like ChatGPT to get accurate and meaningful outputs. Here's how to do it:
- **Be Specific:**
  - Provide clear and detailed instructions.
  - Example:
    Instead of asking *"What is cloud computing?"*, ask
```plaintext
    "Explain the benefits of cloud computing in the healthcare industry."
 ```
- **Assign Roles to AI:**
  - Example:
```plaintext
    "Act as a financial analyst and explain market trends in 2024."
 ```
- **Use Examples:**
  - Guide the model by providing sample outputs.
  - Example:
```plaintext
"Summarize this paragraph in three bullet points."
 ```
- **Define Task Steps:**
  - Break tasks into smaller parts to improve clarity.
- **Control Output Length:**
  - Specify whether you need a short, medium, or detailed response.
 
💡 **Pro Tip:** A well-crafted prompt results in better answers!

## 🔗 Chain of Thought
The **Chain of Thought** process involves breaking down tasks into logical steps for better problem-solving.
### Steps to Use:
1. **Define Steps:** Write each action clearly.
2. **Brainstorm Ideas:** Think of multiple solutions.
3. **Mind Mapping:** Visualize connections between ideas.

## 🎯 Few-Shot Prompting
Few-Shot Prompting is a technique where you provide a few examples to the AI to guide its responses.
### Example:
```plaintext
- Prompt:"Explain the benefits of remote work."
- Examples:
  1. Increased productivity.
  2. Better work-life balance.
  3. Reduced commuting time.
 ```

## 🛠️ Basic Linux Commands
We learned essential Linux commands for beginners:
| Command                 | Description                                      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `echo "Hello World"`    | Prints "Hello World" to the screen.              |
| `ls`                    | Lists files and folders in the current directory.|
| `cd /`                  | Changes directory to the root folder.           |
| `mkdir [folder_name]`   | Creates a new folder.                            |
| `pwd`                   | Displays the current directory path.            |
| `cd code`               | Changes to the "code" folder.                    |
💡 **Tip:** Linux commands are case-sensitive, so type carefully!

## 🐳 Docker Basics: Hello World
Docker simplifies application deployment by running apps in isolated environments called containers. We ran our first Docker container using this command:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
### What is Docker?
- **Portability:** Run applications on any system without compatibility issues.
- **Isolation:** Each container runs independently, avoiding conflicts.
---
## 🌐 File Paths in Linux
File paths can be either **absolute** or **relative**:
- **Absolute Path:**
  - Starts from the root directory (`/`).
  - Example: `/home/user/documents`.
- **Relative Path:**
  - Starts from your current directory.
  - Example: `documents` (if you’re in `/home/user`).
